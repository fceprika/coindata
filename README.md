# Notes during the test

- Tried bunch of apis (coingecko, moralis, bscscan etc.. But turns out Mobula was the best for me to understand and use)
- Found a few bugs while using the Mobula API: pages are slow to load
- BUG: https://docs.mobula.io/rest-api-reference/endpoint/market-history sometimes the page crash when I insert bitcoin and click send. And also when I select 1h.
- BUG: https://admin.mobula.fi/admin/default  the discord and telegram logos are KO
